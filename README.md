An introduction to magnetic resonance imaging analysis in Python.

## Why Python?

Python is rapidly becoming the standard language for data analysis, visualization and automated workflow building. It is a free and open-source software that is relatively easy to pick up by new programmers. In addition, with Python packages such as `Jupyter` one can keep an interactive code journal of analysis - this is what we'll be using in the workshop. Using Jupyter notebooks allows you to keep a record of all the steps in your analysis, enabling transparency and ease of code sharing.

Another advantage of Python is that it is maintained by a large user-base. Anyone can easily make their own Python packages for others to use. Therefore, there exists a *very* large codebase for you to take advantage of for your neuroimaging analysis; from basic statistical analysis, to brain visualization tools, to advanced machine learning and multivariate methods!

## About the Lesson

This lesson teaches:
- a (re?) introduction to MR nomenclature - with BIDS
- "converting" your data to BIDS
- BIDS apps
- queueing up neuroimaging pipelines
- how neuroimaging data is stored
